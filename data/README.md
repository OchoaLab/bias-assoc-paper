## Kinship bias association project data

This folder holds some raw data (raw tables with SRMSD and AUCPR values per dataset, kinship estimator or limit, and replicates in `eval.txt.gz`; also minimum eigenvalues and condition numbers in `eigen.txt.gz`, and variance component estimates and bias factors in `reml.txt.gz`) as well as other summaries, including main tables and figures used in the manuscript.
There are 2 datasets, each in a subfolder with their own dataset-specific data.

Raw genotype data is not available in this repository, due to its size.
The real dataset (1000 Genomes) is available in full elsewhere, see [real data processing instructions](https://github.com/OchoaLab/data) for download and pre-processing instructions.
All of the genotype and phenotype simulations were performed with publicly-available software, including data and code provided in this repository.
